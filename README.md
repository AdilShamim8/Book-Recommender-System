# Book Recommender System

## Overview
A machine learning-powered Book Recommender System that provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading preferences and habits. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest books that align with users' interests.

## Live Demo

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get book suggestions tailored to your reading history and preferences
- **Similar Book Discovery**: Find books similar to ones you've enjoyed in the past
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless navigation
- **Diverse Book Collection**: Access recommendations from a vast library of books across various genres
- **Real-time Processing**: Quickly generate recommendations using optimized algorithms

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms

- **NumPy**: For numerical computing
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end development
- **Render**: Hosting platform for deployment

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdilShamim8/Book-Recommender-System.git
cd Book-Recommender-System
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## How It Works
The recommender system works by analyzing patterns in user ratings and book metadata. It employs two main approaches:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends books based on user similarity
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends books with similar content features

The system processes user input, compares it against the trained model, and generates a list of recommended books that the user might enjoy.

## Dataset
The recommendation system is built using the following datasets:
- Books metadata (titles, authors, publishers, etc.)
- User ratings and reviews
- Book categories and genres

## Future Improvements
- Implement hybrid recommendation techniques
- Add user authentication and profiles
- Incorporate natural language processing for review analysis
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
- Add book availability from various online stores
